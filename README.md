- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing my skills in **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, and **PostgreSQL**.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about **full-stack web development** with a focus on modern frameworks.

- ðŸ¤– My interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Web Development**, and **IoT**.

- ðŸ’» I have experience with **Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **C++**.

- ðŸš€ Some of my past projects include :
    - **[PintarSaham](https://github.com/JustKalvin/pintar_saham_project)**: An educational web application designed to simplify stock market learning. Its core features include interactive learning modules, real-time stock news, dynamic stock charts, and an innovative **"Stock Analysis"** game that integrates ML and GPT models to predict stock price movements (up or down).

    - **[Laughing Face](https://github.com/JustKalvin/ureeka_final_project2)** : A gamified web application focused on improving mental well-being through laughter. Featuring a "Try Not To Laugh" game utilizing face recognition, Smile Simulation, Jokes Generator, journaling, and a leaderboard, this app is designed to create an engaging and fun experience.

    - **[Medical Object Extraction](https://github.com/JustKalvin/CompBio
    )** : This project leverages a Machine Learning model (Biomedical-NER-all) and a GPT model to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on medical objects, then automatically retrieves in-depth definitions for the identified medical entities.

    - **[Stock Market Analysis](https://github.com/JustKalvin/stock-market-project)** : A stock market analysis application utilizing an ML model (LSTM Time Series Analysis) and a GPT model. Its purpose is to predict future stock prices and assist users in making investment decisions, such as when to buy or not.t
